<body><h3><center>Biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan</h3></body>
<p>Ramanuja was born in Erode inTamilnadu on December 22,1887.His father was a petty clerk in cloth shop.
fromearly childhood it was evident that he wasa prodigy.Senior students used to go to his 
dingy houseto get their difficultiesin mathematics solved. At the age of 13,Ramanuja was lent a book on advancedtrignometry written
by S.L.Lonely.Not only did he master this rather difficult book but also began his own research. He came forth with many mathematical theorems,
andformulaes not given in the book,though they had been discovered much earlier by great mathematics.</p><br>
<p>The most significant turn came two years later when one of his senior friend showed him the book A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Applied Mathematics,a collection of 4865 formulas and theorems without proof by G.S.Carr
For a boy of 16 the title itself must be frightening, but Ramanujan was delighted. He took the book home and began to workon the 
problemsgiven in it.This boo triggered the mathematical genius in him.<p><br>
<p>Mathematical ideas began to come in such a flood to his mind that he was not able to write allof them down. He used to do problems on loose sheets of paper or on a slate and jot the  results down in noteboos.Before 
he went abroad he had filled three notebooks,which later became famous as Ramanujan's Frayed Notebooks.<P><hr>
